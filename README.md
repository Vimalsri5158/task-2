      ii.Scope: 
           The document object is a subset of the window object. It provides access to the web page's content and allows you to interact with and manipulate the structure and elements of the page.

     iii.Properties: 
          The document object contains properties and methods that allow you to access and manipulate the HTML elements, such as document.getElementById(), document.querySelector(), and document.body.

      
  **Window Object**

        i.The window object represents the browser window or the global context in which a web page runs. It is the top-level object in the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy.

        ii.Scope: 
             The window object is the global scope for JavaScript in a web page. All global variables and functions are properties and methods of the window object. 

        iii.Properties: 
              The window object includes properties and methods that relate to the entire browser window, such as window.location, window.history, window.navigator, and window.setTimeout().
